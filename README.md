### Hi Everyone 👋 

Welcome to my page!😊 

I am a passionate learner with a keen interest in leveraging data to solve problems and uncover valuable insights.

This GitHub page showcases some of the data science projects I have worked on in the past, as well as my ongoing endeavors, where I'll be continually adding what I am currently working on.

Feel free to explore the repositories and projects to get a glimpse of my data-driven journey. If you have any questions or would like to connect, I'd love to hear from you!

Happy coding! 🚀
